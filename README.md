## Repository Structure

This project contains the designed slide, notes, quiz, coding assignment, and the corresponding solution for hierarchical clustering topic of a proposed course 16ML.

The project structure is as follows:

## Project Summary and Learning Objective
Hierarchical clustering is a general family of clustering algorithms that build clusters by merging or splitting them successively. An integrated course notes and corresponding coding assignment about hierarchical clustering will be given, which suit students who have taken or are taking alongside EECS16B and CS61B at UCB. After learning the notes and completing the assignment, students should be able to achieve the following learning objectives:
- Notes:
	-  Know and understand the definition of hierarchical clustering.
	-  Explain theoretically how hierarchical clustering is different from k-means clustering.
	- Read and plot the dendrogram of hierarchical clustering, and explain the merging or splitting process via the dendrogram.
	- Understand the theory of agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and analysize the corresponding dendrogram.
-  Coding Assignment:
	- Part 1: 
	- Part 2: Write python code that can accomplish agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
	- Part 3:
	- Part 4: 
6. Understand the theory of divisive hierarchical clustering, and analysize the corresponding dendrogram.
7. Write python code that can accomplish divisive hierarchical clustering.
8. Understand and explain different linkages in hierarchical clustering, and code these linkages. 
9. Basically understand different methods of determining number of clusters.
10. Apply written hierarchical clustering code on existing datasets and analysize the performance of clustering.
